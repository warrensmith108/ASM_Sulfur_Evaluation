These scripts are used to perform the analysis and generate figures for a publication by Smith et al. (2026, GRL) on sulfur evaluation and comparison in the Asian monsoon region.

Figure 1 (profile evaluation) can be reproduced using the read_profs_ipy.ipynb script, followed by the plot_profs_ipy.ipynb script.

Figure 2 (sulfate difference maps) can be reproduced using the read_map_info.ipynb script, followed by the plot_map_diff.ipynb script.

Figure 3 (time series of IRF) can be reproduced using the TOA_RF_compare.ipynb script.

Figure 4 (IRF difference maps) can be reproduced using the TOA_RF_maps.ipynb script.
